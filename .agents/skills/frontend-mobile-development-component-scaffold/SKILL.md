# React/React Native Component Scaffolding

Follow these instructions to generate high-quality React or React Native components based on user requirements.

## 1. Requirement Analysis
- Analyze the user's requirements for the component.
- Identify the necessary props, state, and functionality.
- Determine if the component should be a functional component or a class component (functional components with hooks are preferred).
- Check if it's for React (Web) or React Native (Mobile).

## 2. Component Generation
- Generate the component code according to the analysis.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Follow best practices for component structure and naming.
- For React (Web), use Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules for styling.
- For React Native (Mobile), use `StyleSheet.create`.

## 3. Test Generation
- Generate unit tests for the component using Vitest or Jest.
- Test different states and prop combinations.
- Ensure good test coverage.

## 4. Styling Generation
- Provide the necessary styling code.
- Ensure the component is responsive (for Web) or looks good on different screen sizes (for Mobile).

## 5. Storybook Generation
- Generate a Storybook story for the component to allow for easy visual testing and documentation.

## Output Format
Expect the output in a clear, structured format, typically with separate sections for component code, tests, styles, and Storybook stories.
