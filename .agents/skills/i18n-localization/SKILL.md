# Internationalization and Localization

Welcome to the i18n-localization skill. This skill helps you implement internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) in your applications.

## Example
Here is an example of using translated strings:

```javascript
const welcomeMessage = i18n.t('welcome_message');
console.log(welcomeMessage);
```

> [!NOTE]
> This skill is currently minimal and focuses on providing basic patterns for localization.
