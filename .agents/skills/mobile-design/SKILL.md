# Mobile Design System

Design premium, high-performance mobile experiences with a first-principles approach.

## 1. Mobile-First Principles
- Prioritize essential content and actions.
- Design for touch interactions (size, spacing).
- Optimize for small screens and variable aspect ratios.

## 2. Feasibility Assessment (MFRI)
- Evaluate designs for technical feasibility and performance on mobile devices.
- Consider battery life, data usage, and hardware constraints.

## 3. Platform Unification
- Leverage common patterns between iOS and Android while respecting platform-specific conventions where they enhance UX.
- Use adaptive components that feel native on each platform.

## 4. UX Psychology
- Apply principles like Fitts's Law and Hick's Law to mobile layouts.
- Focus on reducing cognitive load and friction.

## 5. Performance Doctrines
- Aim for 60fps/120fps animations.
- Minimize layout shifts and optimize asset loading.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Porting desktop designs directly to mobile.
- Using tiny hit targets.
- Overloading screens with too much information.
- Ignoring offline or poor network states.
- Using non-standard navigation patterns without strong reason.
